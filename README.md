# about-me

Welcome!

My name is Kodiliose F. Emelue and I am a teacher, a software engineer, and a student in the school of life.
I've been taking apart toys, and obsessed with sci-fi since I was very young, but I have been coding since 2020. In my freetime I enjoy making electronic music, playing recreational sports, looking up good recipe's for chicken, and overexplaining my favorite movies.

On this github account you'll find the skills I am practicing, the things that I've learned, and any other projects that excite me.
