# about-me

Welcome!

My name is Kodiliose F. Emelue and I am a teacher, a software engineer, and a student in the school of life.
I've been taking apart toys, and obsessed with sci-fi since I was very young, but I have been coding professionally since 2020. 

In my freetime you'll probably find me doing one of the following: 
- making electronic music
- playing recreational sports
- looking up good recipe's for chicken
- overexplaining my favorite movies
- spamming song recs to my friends
- trying out a new restaurant

On this github account you'll find the skills I am practicing, the things that I've learned, and any other projects that excite me.
